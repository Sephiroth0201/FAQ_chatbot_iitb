# FAQ_chatbot_iitb
I have implemented a chatbot that answers questions that people generally have about IITB, using the RASA Open Source framework.
After creating a virtual environment with python 3.6 and installing and setting up the basic RASA model on it, I started editing the training data in order to suit my purpose.
The bot is designed to answer questions a JEE aspirant might have about IITB. Examples:
1. How are the courses at IITB?
2. Is IITB better than IITD?
3. What is Mood Indigo?
   
I edited the domain.yaml,NLU.yaml,stories.yaml files in order to add addi- tional intents and responses corresponding to various questions about IITB.
The configuration used to train the model was the same as RASAâ€™s default training configuration as we have just added onto the default RASA chatbot.
RASA already has a robust pipeline to train the intent classification and response generation features of the module and is more than sufficient for this purpose.
